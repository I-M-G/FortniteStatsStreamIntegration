## Fortnite Stats - Stream Overlay Integration

__WIP__ - Slowly working on README.
This program allows you to add your Fortnite stats to your stream overlay. The goal is to have stats avaliable for kills, wins and current win streak. You could ultimately add these stats to a Twitch chat bot as well, but the current plan is to set up micro features for streaming and letting the end users pick the features they want to use.

### Application Setup

__Get your API key here:__ [FortniteTracker](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api)

The Fortnite Tracker endpoint is currently:
`https://api.fortnitetracker.com/v1/profile/{platform}/{epic-nickname}`

The three platforms are pc, xbl, and psn. You'll have to pick the correct platform for the epic nickname. I would suggest going to [Fortnite Tracker](https://fortnitetracker.com) and verifying that the nickname is correct. Sometimes the gamertag will be different than the epic nickname.

### OBS and Xsplit Setup
Coming soon
